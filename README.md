A sequence of integers is called **graphical** if there exists a graph with it as
its degree sequence. A [theorem by Erd≈ës and
Gallai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem)
characterizes which sequences are graphical, but gives no algorithm to
explicitly construct such a graph. Can _you_ construct it?
